This is a work sample made by Olle Br√∂ms. Techniques used are:

HTML5:
HTML5Boilerplate incl. shiv for HTML5 backward compatibility.

Twitter Bootstrap:
Modals, tooltips, popovers, fixed navbar, alerts, buttons and responsive design.

Zend Framework:
Translations "ready", custom forms, custom validators and phpunit.

Things that can be improved model management, css templating (less, stylus or sass), tests (10 tests, 4 errors), improved logic on the front-end and to be more efficient use Coffee-script!

Safety:
- Protection against SQL injections.
- Protection against XSS attacks.
- Lacks protection against CSRF attacks.
- Doesnt have any Captcha.
